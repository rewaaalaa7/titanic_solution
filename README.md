# Titanic: Using Multiple Algorithms

# Introduction
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most notorious maritime disasters in history. The Kaggle Titanic dataset provides information about the passengers onboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. In this notebook, we explore various machine learning algorithms to predict the survival outcome for passengers.

# Notebook Structure
The notebook is structured as follows:

1- Data Exploration and Preparation: 
- Loading the dataset
- Exploratory data analysis
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering
  
2- Data Preprocessing:
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
  
3- Model Building and Evaluation:
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
  
4-Model evaluation and comparison

# Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the notebook:

Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

# Running the Notebook
To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies mentioned above.
2. Clone or download the notebook from the repository.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook.
4. Navigate to the directory where the notebook is located.
5. Open the notebook file (titanic-using-multiple-algorithms.ipynb).
6. Execute each cell in sequential order to reproduce the results.
